          <h2>What does the future of technology look like?</h2>

          <h3>How will the technology evolve? How this might be different? </h3>
          <h3>How will it effect people or the industry?</h3>

          <h2 style={{color:'#e6c068'}}>  üåü 1. AI has a promising future.</h2>
            <p>
            I have been seeing the conversations around ‚ÄúIs AI a dying field‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think so. In fact, the global market size of AI in 2021 was $422.37+ billion and is likely to grow at 39.4% CAGR during 2022-2028 according to a Bloomberg article. There was a shift toward solving the problems to make AI better and productionizing it. We solved problems including data quality, data silos, the inclusion of diverse data, reducing unbiasedness in decision making, improved collaboration between teams, availability of technologies to make decisions on fresh or near real-time data, improved efficiency in operations, introducing solutions to handle the compliance, security, 
            and regulation. Now that we have solutions to those problems, the industry would be able to use AI for critical decision-making. 
            </p>

            <h2 className="blog-lion-heading">‚ú®  2. Rise of AI on the edge. </h2>
            <h3>With the enhanced computation and AI-enabled technology, the defence industry can make instant decision by recognizing and classifying target images.</h3>

            <p>
             They are embedding AI on IoT sensors of their devices to achieve this. AI can unlock precision in results for more effective decision-making. By combining geospatial analysis for surveillance like notifying authorities of suspicious activity. Other use cases include using computer vision to improve driving conditions by detecting stop signs and detecting harsh driving, improving operation efficiency in deliveries by minimizing food waste, and reducing carbon footprints. All this is made possible because the AI on the edge is now capable of making instant decisions as soon as the data arrives.
            </p>

             
 <h2 style={{color:'#e6c068'}}> üåü3. Data Processing is moving to real-time.</h2>

 <p>More and more companies are moving their day/hours of latency workloads to minute latency. This is driven by two things 1) lower processing cost and 2) business demand for lower latency. E.g. many companies used to have 1 day SLA for their BI workloads, now 30 minutes are common. </p>

<h3>More and more minutes and seconds latency use cases and workloads have emerged over the past five years.</h3>
<p>There are three drivers 1) emerging applications like real-time recommendation, dynamic UI, fraud detection, etc. 2) more and more streaming data sources like mobile and IoT devices 3) streaming technologies becoming easier and more prevalent. </p>
 
             

            <h4 style={{color:'#e6c068'}}> üåü 4. Growing trend of open source adoption. </h4>
            <p>1000s of projects that are powering innovation in AI are available as open source. We hear a lot of pains around tech debt, and migrating from legacy to modern tools. </p>
            <h3>With the advent of open source, companies are not only embracing it but embedding open souce into their organization strategy. </h3>

            <p>By engaging and investing in open source, companies gain instant access to a large community of developers. Publicly contributing also positions a company as an innovator and is perceived as being open to ideas from the external community. Developers also love the fact that they can dig into source code and build their technical reputation in the community.
            </p>
             


            <h4 style={{color:'#e6c068'}}> üåü 5. Diversity and Inclusion in Tech.</h4>
            <p>Companies in recent years placed diversity at the core, which resulted in access to diverse perspectives, experiences, and skillsets. </p>
<h3>This will likely result into unbiased AI, more innovative end user products. </h3>
            <p>
              Accessibility is another area of D&I. Tech makers will likely be more cautious to include accessibility features into their design. If you attend a LinkedIn live or audio event, for example, you will see captions. Alt text when uploading a short-form video or photo post is another great example. Check out LinkedIn Accessibility.
            </p>
            <h4>Community Connections: Collaboration, Conversations & Coffee</h4>

           <p>No tech event is complete without the opportunity to connect with friends, peers, and fellow AI enthusiasts. Whether it was over coffee or in breakout discussions, the chance to share experiences, tackle common challenges, and exchange ideas with others in the AI community was truly inspiring.

These informal conversations are where future collaborations begin ‚Äî sparking innovation that goes beyond the event itself.</p>

            
             

            <h2 className="blog-lion-heading">6. How technology is going to impact people?</h2>

            <h3><span style={{color:'#e6c068'}}>Low code/no code:</span> Skills gap is identified as one of the main obstacles to adoption. [Here‚Äôs a poll I launched to understand this]. To make technology more accessible and usable by a wider audience, companies are working on making the technology simple. This will likely include more low code/no code solutions which can bridge the gap between tools requiring different programming languages for diversely skilled forces. </h3>

            <h3> <span style={{color:'#e6c068'}}> Explainable AI:</span> AI should be explainable and not just be a black box. Developers are realizing this gap and will likely place more focus on how AI works and how to interpret the output of designed models. </h3>

            <h3> Improvements in lifestyle and home automation. From using NFC tags to build your own apps or even improve home automation, to using QR codes for easy payments or access to digital ID, end users now have easy access to these tools. For example, you can use NFC tags to program a schedule for laundry or automate your daily chores. Watch this video by Allie K. Miller where she shows productivity hacks to improve daily life. </h3>

            <h2>Technology is made much simple to be directly used by diverse customers to improve their daily lifes. </h2>

            <h3> <span style={{color:'#e6c068'}}>Creator tools:</span> More companies are realizing the value of raising awareness and simplicity of tech adoption through content and influencers. We are likely to see more companies emerging with creator tools and shifting towards a creator economy. </h3>

            <h3> <span style={{color:'#e6c068'}}>Community and Advocacy:</span> This year I participated in at least 10 conferences and meetups and was able to talk to 100s of developers and peer companies. Every company I talked to either had or actively working on community initiatives and advocacy. Developing an amazing product may not be enough. Raising awareness and establishing a community of users and evangelizing for practitioners can go a long way. At Databricks, I have been a part of the advocacy and open source efforts and have seen amazing results in terms of impressive growth in the community, contributions, and product adoption.</h3>
             

             <h2> üåü 7. Impact on the Industry.</h2>

             <h3 style={{color:'#e6c068'}}>Companies are likely to see a decline in growth for next couple of years. </h3>

             <p>The outlying situations like the pandemic caused a boom or a bubble for everything from stocks to the housing market. During the pandemic, companies that were in fast-forward modes like food and commodity delivery, crypto, video, and gaming companies saw massive growth. Zoom, for example, grew from 250 million to 20 billion during the pandemic. Now Zoom‚Äôs growth decreased to 10%. Salesforce which saw 40% growth during the pandemic is down to 25% growth now.  Startups that came about during the pandemic are failing now because consumer demands have drastically shifted. I still believe that companies that are able to scale for larger use cases and are innovative will be able to get financial grants and can make a comeback. It would be fair to accept that we are in recession, and it will likely take nearly a couple of years to correct. Federal rates increase and inflation is a part of it. Growth is likely to come down for companies but companies who are to stay will likely grow again in 2-3 years.</p>
            <h1>How will companies react to the looming economic downturn?</h1>
            <h3>We will likely see more and more companies exercising discipline and control in the near future. Being paranoid, aggressive cost savings, operational rigor, and profitability can likely be on top of mind for the companies. </h3>
